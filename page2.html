<h3>Vampires do not sparkle, but their eyes do.</h3>
<p>
    We are not entirely sure where Stephanie Myer got this misconception, Steve has his theories, but vampires do NOT sparkle. The NVHA believes this myth started from the myth that the sun hurts and even disintegrates vampires, which is also not true.

    But their eyes do sparkle, or in this sense the proper term would be that they glow under the correct circumstances. Normally when they are feeling intense emotion, the most common ones being agitation and anger. So your best friend that never leaves his house without sunglasses? See if getting under his skin turns his irises a crimson tint - even if it is just for a second.

<h3>Vampires do not sleep</h3>
<p>
    This one has stood tried and true for however long vampires have existedâ€¦which is a very long time according to our Infinite Archive Room. While there are a few rumours that they sleep in coffins this is also another lie made up by the media, as that would be a waste of a perfectly good coffin. Vampires are already half dead, so it is very insulting to assume they would want to sleep in something that reminds them of the lack of their own mortality.

    So if you want to check and see if someone is a vampire, have a sleepover! Of course at your own risk.
