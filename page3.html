<h3>Vampires ABSOLUTELY need to be invited in.</h3>
<p>
    Their manners won't let them otherwise. Doesn’t matter how impolite they were when they were mortal, immortality requires them to be polite. Therefore they must not enter someone else's area without permission. And it is quite hilarious watching one try to enter an area that they haven’t been invited in, it’s like something has hold of their feet and won't let them take even the closest step towards the entrance.

    So if you have your theories, walk into your house and see if your friend waits by the door. If they insist on you inviting them in, they could possibly be a vampire…so don’t.

<h3>Vampires absolutely despise cooked meat</h3>
<p>
    Considering that their diets often involve anything still moving, this hypothesis was met with obvious answers. The more alive their meal the stronger they get from it, and if they even get a whiff of a seared steak their stomach tells them to turn in the other direction.

    The NVHA is currently conducting tests to see if cooked meat can debilitate vampires, we will revise the guide after further research.

    A good experiment to run is to invite your friends to a barbeque to weed out the possible vamps in your pose.
