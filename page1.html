<h1>A Guide on How to Identify a Vampire.</h1>
<p>
    With the growing occult obsession with horror, so does the knowledge of “fictional” monsters grow with it. But along with the growth of our classic horror movies do we forget that actual monsters exist. That sure, while Jason is plenty scary and Freddy could take you out with one swipe of his hand we must not forget that monsters are plenty real.

    Despite what some people might tell you.

    Vampires have existed for thousands of years, feeding on our fears (and throats). Twilight hasn’t done the monster hunting business any good in boiling down their threat, and let's not talk about that embarrassing photo of Nosferatu that has not aged well in putting genuine caution on the topic of vampires.

    Now while we commend Johnny Depp’s performance, and the very talented writers who created Straud, the National Vampire Hunting Association has decided to make this short guide to help keep the mortal population identify who amongst their friend group is a vampire or not. What you do with that information is up to you afterward.

    <h3>Note: Please contact your local NVHA if you do identify a vampire in your area, even if it is dear old dad.</h3>
